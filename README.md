# Machine Learning

A collection of machine learning projects.

These are machine learning projects that primarily use 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), 
[xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), 
[lightgbm](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/v3.3.5), 
and any other models I find while learning.

Some Kaggle Competition notebooks are here, too.
